                      Randall had just moved to Seattle from Michigan and Meghan had just graduated from college. Over the next few months they bonded over
                      a shared love of skiing. Eventually, they went on their first hike together and discovered a new love for the outdoors. In August 2016 after many hiking, camping, and ski trips,
                      they returned to Bumping Lake, the site of their first camping trip. This is where Randall proposed and they decided to spend the rest of their lives together.
